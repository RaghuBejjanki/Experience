DNS is Domain Naming System or Service. It translates the domain names to ip addresses.
It acts as a phone book and translates the human readable domain names to ip addresses.
It uses UDP and uses port number 53.
Earlier DNS services were based on HOSTS.TXT file.
Domain names and IP addresses are the 2 important keys present.
DNS name server stores DNS records for a domain and responds to queries against its database.
Common types of records present in the database are A and AAAA, MX(SMTP mail exchangers), name servers(NS), pointers for reverse DNS lookups(PTR) and Canonical Names(CNAME) or domain name aliases.

Domain names : .org, .com, yahoo, google are all domain names.

hostnames: a computer name. A hostname and ip address are present for the computer.

DNS lookup steps:
1. When user types example.com. The query is received by DNS recursive resolver.
2. The resolver then queries the root nameserver(.)
3. Root server responds with address of Top Level Domain(TLD) server(.com, .net).
4. The server then queries TLD.
5. The TLD server then responds with ip address of domain's nameserver(example.com).
6. Lastly recursive resolver sends query to domain name server.
7. ip address of example.com is then returned to resolver by nameserver.
8. DNS resolver then responds to web browser with ip address.
9. Browser makes http request to the ip address.
10. server at that ip address returns web page to be rendered by the browser.

DNS steps:
1) DNS recursor: It will receive query from web browser of client. It will send to root server.
2) Root server: It will send information about TLDs.
3) TLD server: It will send information about Domain nameserver(Authoritative name server).
4) Authoritative name server: It will return the ip address of request domain name to the recursor.

DNS cacheing is done to make data available as close to client.
# cat /etc/hosts file

127.0.0.1 , ::1 localhost is used to configure the loopback interface.

A record: hostname is resolved to ipv4 address.
AAAA record: hostname is resolved to ipv6 address.
PTR record: ip address is resolved to hostname.

Mail Exchangers(MX): Its refers to a host which is acting as Message Transfer Agent(MTA). MTA sends electronic mail from client to server and vice-verse.

Name server(NS): This Implements the network service for providing the responses against the directory service.

Reverse DNS lookups: Its the determination of domain name based on the ip address.

When the ip address is changed, it will updated in the DNS server and user will not experience problems because there is no change in the domain name.
DNS zone may consist of a single domain or many domains and sub domains.

Domain syntax: www.example.com. . is the root server
com is the top level domain. example is subdomain of com domain and www is subdomain of example.com domain. total 127 levels can exist.
domain name should not exceed 253 characters.
www.example.com and example.com are hostnames but com is not hostname.

DNS is maintained by Database. Each node of this database is a nameserver. Top of the hierarchy is the root name server which resolve the top level domains.

In Address resolving, initially DNS resolver(client) will ask DNS server about ip address which checks in inital cache, if present returns from there, otherwise asks the
TLD which in turn will ask the secondary servers. In real time, caching is used in DNS servers to avoid this bottleneck.

DNS servers also act as DNS caches to improve the performance and and gain efficiency.

DNS use UDP with port number 53 for single request followed by response. If response packet size is > 512, then TCP is used. some implementations use TCP for all request and responses.

DNS resolver sitting on the client side will send either non-recursive or recursive.
In non-recursive, the DNS server provides a record for which it is administrative or partial result without querying other servers.
In recursive, DNS server will also query other servers to answer fully.

name server: A Web server with DNS installed. When a domain name(www.example.com) is registered, atleast 2 name servers(Just for redundancy) must be configured to handle the requests.
NS records: TLD place NS records for your domain in TLD name servers.
Time server: Server that reads the actual time from the reference clock and distributes this information to clients within a network.
Widely used protocol for this is NTP.
White list ip address : list of ip address that are considered spam free. users can receive or send to whitelist addresses.
Black list ip address : list of ip address that needs to be blocked. Blacklists are generally used to filters the mails.

# For DNS issues debugging in linux or MAC:
> nslookup google.com # easy command find the domain to ip address
under the non-authoritative answer of the command output, ip address will be shown.

> dig google.com # more detailed form to find the domain to ip address.
for trouble shooting dns related we can really use above.

if we want to find more extensive details, we can use host command
>host -a www.google.com  # we can get CNAME, ipv6 address  etc.
>host -t NS www.google.com # we can get the NameSpace record information.
