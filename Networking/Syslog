Syslog is a way for network devices to send event messages to logging server usually called syslog server.
It logs different types of events like when an AP is connected, when a controller is connected, disconnected etc.
Syslog server needs to consolidate logs from multiple sources.
A syslog listener needs to gather data sent over UDP port 514.
So some may not arrive as UDP. So some use TCP 1468 to ensure delivery.
General syslog format has ip address, timestamp and actual message log.

facility: syslog has concept called "facility" to identify the source of the message on any given machine.
example:
facility 0 = kernel message.
facility 1  = user level messages
facility 2 = mail system
facility 11 = FTP deamon etc.
facility 16 = local use 0(local0)
... local1 to local6
facility 23 = local use 7(local7)

severity: Syslog messages also have severity field called which indicates how much message is important.
0 = emergency
1 = alert,
2 = critical
3 = error
4 = warning
5 = notice
6 = informational
7 = debug

Each syslog message has priority value which is at the beginning of text. It is enclosed <priority>.
Priority value = 8 * facility + severity.

RFC specify log should contain timestamp.

Hostname: Hostname can either be FQDN, hostname, static ip address, dynamic ip address of the machine which generated the messages.

Kiwi syslog server I have used.

-> CEF format?
Common Event Format.
It allows for interoperability. Which means when 1 company sends syslogs other companies can receive and understand it.

Python module: SocketServer module is used to implement syslog server.

All the latest linux systems comes with syslogd.
It provides an API for logging to standard library.

The main configuration file is:
> cat /etc/syslog.conf
> cat /etc/asl.conf ( or for mac systems)

To get the pid of syslog that is running.
>cat /etc/run/syslog.pid
