ROUTING INFORMATION PROTOCOL(RIP):
Its a routing protocol for small and medium networks. It uses distance-vector algorithm to calculate routes.

RIP v1 is classful. RIPv2 is classless.
RIP v1 supports no VLSM. RIPv2 supports VLSM.
AD(120) is same for RIP v1, v2.
RIP V2 uses UDP port 520.
multicast is 224.0.0.9.

#config# router rip
#config-router# version 2 # version 1 is default.
#config-router# network x.x.x.x
#config-router# no auto-summary # default it auto-summarizes

RIPng: RIP next generation
successor to v2.
RIP for IPV6.
RIPng uses UDP port 521.
no-autosummarization.
multicast address FF02::9

Configuration:
#config#ipv6 unicast-routing
#config# ipv6 router rip <name>
#config# ipv6 rip <name> enable

If you want to enable on interface.
#config-intf# ipv6 rip <name> enable

Ripv1 and v2 timers are same:
update: 30 seconds
invalid: 180 sec. route becomes invalid since valid update.
holddown timer: 180 seconds.
flush timer: 240 seconds. from valid to becoing valid and flushing out the route.

Q&A:
> Maximum hop count for RIP and RIPng is 15.
> RIP cannot receives updates scenario: firewall blocked UDP port 520.
> Unlike ospf and eigrp, RIP cannot be enabled on interface level. Only in #config-router# it can be enabled.
> hop count of 16 is treat as unreachable.
> RIP v2 supports only classful supernet networks.
> ripng timer can be modified in #router(config-rtr)# mode.
> ipv4 rip timer can be modified in #config-router# mode.
> Default authentication mode in rip v2 is plain text.
> Rip v1 does not support authentication.
> To form neighbors, for ripng uses UDP 521 ported must be permitted.
> ripv1, v2 use UDP port 520.
> To support ripng, "ipv6 unicast-routing" must be configured.
> ripng on new customer link is enabled on interface mode.
> ripng is enabled on global configuration mode.
> global - config#ipv6 router rip "RIPNG" RIPng is ocnfigured on new link to partner using RIPng.
> 240 seconds needs to waited before removing from routing table after ripv2 router loses its connectivity with neighbor.
> RIpng neighbor adjacencies are shown in "show ipv6 rip next-hops"
