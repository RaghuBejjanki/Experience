NTP: Network Time Protocol

All the network devices should be in sync.
Router can be a time source in same network or external time source(NTP server).

Top of NTP hierarchy are stratum 0 devices, typically atomic clocks.
cisco router cannot be configured with stratum 0 server.
NTP uses UDP port 123 by default.
cisco router can be configured NTP server or clients or peers.
NTP server will send message to clients. Clients will not send message to server. client peer can send again sync messages to another peer.

NTP stratum: Stratum is how accurate the time is. Its the representation of hierarchy of time servers in NTP network.
stratum 0 means directly connected(GPS antenna). The lower the stratum number the more timing accuracy.
High stratum levels devices are NTP servers.
cisco default stratum value is 8.
127.127.1.1 is like loopback address for ntp master.
127.127.7.1 indicates the internal server created by ntp master command.


NTP lab:

R1(Server) <-> R2(Client)


R1
#config# ntp master 1<1-14>

R2:
#config# ntp server 1.1.1.2

#show ntp association
#show ntp status

NTP authentication:

R3(Client) <-> R4(server)

R4: server
#config# ntp authenticate
#config# ntp authentication-key 1 md5 CCNP
#config# ntp trusted-key 1

R3: Client
#config# ntp authenticate
#config# ntp authentication-key 1 md5 CCNP
#config# ntp trusted-key 1
#config# ntp server 1.1.1.2 key 1

NTP does not authenticate clients, it only authenticates source.

NTP clients without authentication as well can sync with NTP servers. This means NTP clients can make use of authentication if required else not required.

To avoid this, acls can be configured.

On server:
# config# access-list 33 permit host 10.1.1.3
# config# ntp access-group serve-only 33

On client side unconfigure and configure ntp server command to this effect.

NTP version 3,4:

version 4 is backward compitable with version 3. NTPv4 also adds DNS support for IPV6.
NTPv3 supports broadcast message whereas v4 uses multicast.
NTPv4 allows increased security.

we can configure version by adding version keyword at end of server and peer commands.

#config# ntp server x.x.x.x version 4
#cofig# ntp peer x.x.x.x version 4

Q&A:
> "ntp broadcast client" enables receiving NTP broadcasts on the interface where the command is executed.
> ntp client polls server for time and listens to NTP broadcasts.
> If multiple NTP servers are configured, 1 with lowest stratum is preferred.
> NTP has 4 access groups: serve, peer, serve-only and query-only. NTP services can be permited to only acl group with <ntp access> only etc.
> NTP client can update local system without updating or synchronizing remote system using "Serve" command.
> stratum 16 indicates the device is unsynchronized.
> ntp trusted key during authentication cen be configured on server, client and broadcast.
> "show ntp associations" shows synchronized ntp servers that are configured on device.
> "show ntp status" shows ip address of the peer to which the clock is synchronized, where the clock is synchronized.
> NTP stratum 1 is directly connected to authoritative time source.
> NTP stratum 2 receives their time from peer that is directly connected to an authoritative time source.
> client, server and broadcast that NTP operating modes must the trusted-key be configured.
> Uses UDP port 123.
> For NTP client to be able to update the local system without updating or synchronizing with remote system, NTP serve option of ntp access group is used.
