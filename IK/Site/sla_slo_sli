SLA : Service level Agreement

SLO : Service level Objective

SLI : Service level Indicators.

The secret of above is availability.

What is SLA? A promise you make
    Say I built a website and 1000 people subscribed.
    I tell those people that my site is 99% of time in a year and response time 1 ms in 95%.
    If I don't meet that I will refund you.

what is SLO? A goal you set.
    I within my team keep an SLO 99.5 % of time in a year so that I keep promise of my SLA.

What are service level indicators? metrics to allow to set SLA.
    - They indicate the performance of your service.
    - Throughput, latency, error rate, numnber of requests served, queries per second(qps) etc.
