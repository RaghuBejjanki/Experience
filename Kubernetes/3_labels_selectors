Labels:
    Labels are key/value pairs.
    They are attached to resources like pods, deployments, service etc.
    Based on labels we can segregate the resources like prod, dev etc.
    It is defined under metadata section.
    We can select the pods based on labels for rolling updates, scaling(create replicas based on label) and send traffic to a pod etc.

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: my-pod
      labels:
        app: my-app
        env: production
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: my-image

    In this example there are 2 labels, app: my-app, env: production.

    > kubectl get pods -l env=production     # all the pods which have production label are displayed.


    > kubectl run nginx --image=nginx   # to run a pod
    > kubectl label pod nginx env=prod   # attached label prod to pod. env=prod is the label.
    > kubectl get pods --show-labels     # to show the label attached to pod.

Selectors:
    selector is way to match set of k8 resources based on labels.
    There are 2  types  of selectors: label selectors and field selectors.

    Label selectors: Label selector is used to match resources based on labels.
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: my-service
    spec:
      selector:
        app: my-app

    label selector matches all pods with the label app=my-app.

    field selector: match resources based on their fields.
    > kubectl get pods --field-selector=status.phase=Running    # currently running pods are displayed.
