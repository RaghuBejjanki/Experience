Probes:
    Probes  are used to monitor the health of containers running in pod.
    There are 3 types of probes.

    1) Liveness probe:
        Checks if container is running or not. If this fails, k8 consider container as dead and will start new.
        It is httpget. If the response is ok or not.

    2) Readiness probe:
        Checks if container is ready to server the requests. If this fails, k8s removes it from service endpoint until is passes again.

    3) Startup probe:
        Checks if the container has started and ready to server the requests. If its taking time, k8s delay the readiness probe until container is ready.
        It is executed first, until it is success other probes are not executed.
