Resource requests and limits:
    requests:
        specify minimum amount of CPU and memory that a container or pod requires.
        This helps schedular to decide on which node pod can be run. If there are no nodes, pod will be in pending state.
    limits:
        specify maximum amount of CPU and memory that a container or pod requires.
        When pod reaches resource limit, k8s will either throttle or evict the pod depending on config.

    At the pod level, resource requests and limits are set using the spec.containers[].resources.requests
    and spec.containers[].resources.limits fields in a pod's definition.
