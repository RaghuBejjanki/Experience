AWS, google, microsoft etc cloud service provide API gateway.

For clients like pc, mobile, web, API gateway is the single point of entry.
It sits between client and backend services.

API Gateway provides:
- authentication and security policy enforcement.
- load balancing
- protocol translation and service discovery
- monitoring, logging, analytics and billing.
- caching

API gateway flow

Client --- send request(cloud be REST/graph ql http or some other) --> API gateway validates the request ---->

API Gateway checks Allow list and deny list(Also rate limit) ---> API Gateway passes the request to Identity provider for

Authentication/Authorization(Here rate limit check is done, like logins per second) ---> API gateway service discovery and dynamic routing

component locates appropriate backend service component --> API gateway transfer request into appropriate protocol and sends to service.

Once response is received for request, the reverse process is executed until response receives client.



rate limit: The API gateway can reject requests from a particular ip address after some rate limit is reached in particular time.

API gateway should be deployed at multiple regions to improve availability.
Many cloud providers deploy at multiple locations near to client.
