Redis began cacheing db but evolved into primary db.

- Redis in In memory(RAM) db not db. Which means memory access is faster and high read/write through put than disk.
- Code wise it is very simple to implement than on-disk.
- Redis is single-thread which avoid locking mechanism with multi-threaded and hence solid performance.
  With single-thread, sometimes thread gets blocked waiting for completion. TO avoid this, IO multiplexing is used.
  IO multiplexing: OS allows single thread app to wait on many sockets simultaneously. Generally select and poll system calls
  are used. Epoll performance varient system call is used in redis which supports many sockets.
- In multi-core CPUs, 1 Redis instance is run on 1 cpu.
