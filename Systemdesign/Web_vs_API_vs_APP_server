Difference between Web server, API server and APP server?
    Web server:
        Responsible for serving static content like HTML, CSS and Javascript files to the client.
        Client's browser then renders them.
        Eg: Apache and Nginx.

    API server:
        It is responsible for exposing the APIs that allows client apps to communicate with the server.
        API servers are typically built on microservices based architectures.

    App server:
        It is responsible for executing server side application code and returning the results to the client.
        App server typically runs a framework like flask, django etc.
        App server runs the business logic and handles the db and other services.
