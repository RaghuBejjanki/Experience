Exponential backoff:
    It is used for handling network errors and congestion.
    The idea is the gradually increase amount of time between subsequent retries of failed request.
    It reduces the risk of overloading the server with too many requests.

    Working:
    - Client sends request to server.
    - If it fails, client waits for short period of time(100 ms) and retries the request.
    - If it fails again, client waits for longer period of time(200 ms) and retries again.

    If dealing with temporary network outages or large number of clients sends requests which overwhelms the server, we can avoid
    this using exponential backoff.
