What happens when you type url in browser?

When you type url http://www.example.com/product/user/phone.
url - uniform Resource locator.
http: is a scheme. Its a protocol that tells the browser to connect to another system. Here we used http(port 80), we can also you https(port 443).
With https connection is encrypted.
example.com : its a domain. Its the domain name of the site. Browser needs to know how to reach the server(ip). This is done through DNS lookup.
DNS translates domain names to ip addresses. To make DNS lookup faster, Caching is done at multiple levels. First browser caches the ip for some time.
If browser does not have it, it asks OS. If OS does not have it, Browser looks up ip using recursive dns lookup until ip is found.
Now browser got the ip. It makes connection using http or https. A 3 way handshake is done before establishing the tcp connection.
Once established, modern browsers use keep-alive to reuse established tcp connection. If https is used, handshake is even more complicates using
SSL/TLS handshake. Once established, the browser sends a simple http request and receives the http response and renders the content.
product/user: path. Imagine as directory.
phone: resource. Imagine as file in file system.
