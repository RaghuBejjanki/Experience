HTTPS sends the data in encrypted format.
This encryption form is called TLS. Transport Layer Security.


Steps:
1. TCP handshake: Similar to Http, first browser establishes the connection with server using 3 way TCP handshake.
2. Certificate check: This is called TLS handshake. browser sends "client hello" to server.
   hello msg contains
        1) What TLS version is supported. TLS 1.2, 1.3 etc.
        2) What cipher suites(its encryption algo to encrypt data) it supported. RSA etc.
   Server chooses and sends "server hello" msg and certificate to client.
   Server sends lot of information in certificate. One of them is server public key in asymmetric encryption.
   Asymmetric encryption: A piece of data that is encrypted by public can only be decrypted by private key.
   At the end, client and server have agreed on TLS version, cipher suite used and certificate.
3. key change: client generates an session key which is encrypted by server's public key is sent to server.
    server after receiving the encryption key, decrypts using its private key.
4. Data transmission: Encrypted data is transmitted using symmetric encryption.
    symmetric encryption: single key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data.
    here symmetric encryption is used since asymmetric is computationally expensive and not suitable for bulk transmission.
