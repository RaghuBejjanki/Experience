Bastion host provides remote access to private networks from an external network.
Bastion host acts a bridge between public internet and private hosts.
Used as SSH proxy servers to support system/network administration and for monitoring servers.
Bastion host is placed outside the firewall or DMZ, it becomes the only ingress path to access internal resources.
ACL, allowlists and other network level access controls limit access from the bastion to its protected subnets.

Bastion hosts can become target of cyber attacks.
ssh security weakness include:
- private ssh keys does not expire automatically.
- old vulnerable ssh hashing algorithms are still in use.
- ssh has no built-in integration with identity providers.
