Where do we cache data?

Data is caches everywhere.

1. Client apps: HTTP repsonses can be cached by browser. when we request the data for the first time, the response is returned
                with expiry policy in the http header. When we request again, client app tries to retrieve the data from browser first.

2. CDN : CDN caches static web resources. The clients can retrieve data from CDN node nearby.

3. Load Balancer: It can caches the resources as well.

4. Message infra: Message brokers like kafka store messages on disk first and then consumers retrieve them at their own pace.
                  kafka stores messages from a period of time.

5. Services : Services cache the data at multiple layers like at cpu cache, RAM cache and disk cache.

6. Distributed cache: Distributed cache like redis hold key-value pairs for multiple services in memory.
                       This provides much better read/write performance than dbs.

7. Full text search: Tools like elastic search search for full text.

8. Databases: Data is cached at db level as well.
                In db, memory is allocated to cache query results.
