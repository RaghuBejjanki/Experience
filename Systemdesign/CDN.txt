CDN: Content Delivery Network.

It was designed to speed up the static HTML content delivery to end users around the world.

To make content faster to reach users, CDN deploys 100 of server across the world. These servers are called Point Of Presence(POPs).

Different CDN providers like Amazon, Akamai, Cloudflare use different technologies.
2 common ones are 1) DNS based routing 2) Anycast.

1) DNS based routing: Each POPs has different ip. When user looks up for ip, the DNS returns nearest POP ip address.

2) Anycast: All POPs have same ip. The network sends the request to nearest POP.

Each POP acts as reverse proxy with the huge content.
Since the POP only asks for a copy if its not there, it reduces the cost and bandwidth.

Modern CDNs improve the content format of the files(video 720p, 1080p etc), reduce the size of files, transform image file
from old format to new format.

All TLS connections terminate at CDN which significantly reduces the round trip time during the connection establishment.
It also provides security to the origin server.
