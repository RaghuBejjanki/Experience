SSO: Single Sign On.

SSO is an authentication scheme. It allows users to securley access to multiple applications with single ID.

With SSO, User can access many apps without login each time.

SSO is built on concept called federated identity.

user ---> my company cloud(service provider) ---> identity provider(okta) ----> slack(other service providers)

Identity provider shares identity information across multiple secure apps.

2 types:
- SAML : Security Assertion Markup Language
        It's an xml based open standard for exchanging identity information across multiple apps.

        Working:
        - When a person tries to connect to my company app(Service providerSP), it sends SAR(Saml Authentication Request) to browser.
          SAR is xml doc which tells to talk to company.okta.com
        - The browser redirects the SAR to Identity provider(IDP- okta).
        - The identity provider sends the login page to user.
        - Once user enter login details, the IDP sends the signed SAML assertion. This is called SAML assertion.
          SAML assertion contains user details and what user can access with service provider.
        - browser sends signed assertion response to service provider. Service provider validates that the assertion is signed IDP.
          This is generally done by public key cryptography.
        - Then access is granted.

- Open ID connect : Google uses it. It uses JWT(Json Web Token) to share identity information between services.
        Its implementation is different but overall concept is same. Instead of SAML but it uses Json instead of saml.
