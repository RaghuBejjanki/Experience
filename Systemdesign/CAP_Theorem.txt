C = consistency
A = Availability
P = Partition tolerance

Consistency:
    All nodes will have same consistent view of data.
    All clients see same data at same time no matter which node they connect to.

Availability:
    Respond to users requests at all times.

Partition Tolerance:
    Even with network partition, it network continues to operate.

When there is network partition, either Consistency or availability must be choosen.

If consistency is priority during network partition, then few of the nodes will be unavailable.
If availability is priority, then data inconsistency will happen until network partition is resolved.

If a banking system opts for consistency, then few nodes will be unavailable during network partition and if
it opts for high availablity, then data may not be consistent across the nodes.
