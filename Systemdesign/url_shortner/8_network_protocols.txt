from example www.urlshortner.com is the name of website. So using the DNS, we get the ip address of the server.

If server is running and serving multiple services. To retrieve a particular service, apart from ip, port number
is also needed. port number will say the service running on the host.

So a packet contains

-> Request, ip+port of source(client) , ip+port of destination(server).
<- Response, ip+port of source(server) , ip+port of destination(client).

Client and server must follow rules(protocol) to communicate with each other.
IP - Internet Protocol for ip addresses format related.
http - For delivering the web pages.

> curl(Client url) -v http://bit.ly/Ipaddr

This displays request using > and response using <.
This returns 301(permanently moved) as this is the short url.
returns the html content and bit.ly ip.
