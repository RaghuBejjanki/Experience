Url shortner uses client server architecture where for each long url requested by client, server returns shorter form of that url.

Short names:

CTR = Click Through Rate
    = no. of people clicked the ad/ no.of people saw the ad * 100

if there are 5 clicks, then CTR is 5%.

URL = Uniform Resource Locator.
TTL = Time To Live

Throughput = Amount of time that an application takes to respond to an app = measured in data/sec. like bytes/sec, MB/sec
Latency = Is the actual time of request + response = measured in time.

Latency and throughput are inverse of each other.
More throughput is better but less latency is better.

10k = 10,000
100k = 100,000
1 million = 1,000,000
1 billion = 1,000,000,000
