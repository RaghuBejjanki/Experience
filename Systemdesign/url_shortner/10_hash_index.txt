How to store hash table in disk?
key: value
{shorturl: longurl} -----> record
{myAddr: maps.google.com}

We can use hash table in file called data file. We can do insert and search operations on this file.
This is Append-only file. In DBs terms its called log.

This can be stored in memory or disk.
But disk seek(getting data from disk) is very expensive.
So we will have HASH INDEX in RAM(in memory). In DBs terms, it is called index.
{key: Value} => {short_url: offset_in_data_file(address of record in file)}

and record will be disk which contains
{shorturl: longurl}. This way disk seek will be faster.

offset size will very small compared to longurl(2048 chars).

This is a constant time operation.

    App -----> Cache ------> DB
    nothin      k:v in       k:v pairs of short:longurls
    here        memory
                hash table
