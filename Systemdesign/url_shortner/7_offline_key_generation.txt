Generation of short url does not depend on long url(for timestamp/ counter value).
So we can pregenerate short urls and store them in advance.
We can have a seperate program for this. we can keep in urls in set(so that duplicates are removed).
We can call this job as "key generation service".


Cons: Lot of space is required to save.
