Jenkins pipeline can be created using pipeline or multibranch pipeline projects. Both will give Pipeline script.
using which we can create a pipeline.

tools{
maven 'Maven 3.6.1'  # use 1 or more tools.
}
stages{
stage('one:build'){
steps{
echo 'step 1'
dir('worker'){
sh 'mvn compile'
}
}

}
stage('two:test'){
steps{
echo 'step 2'
}

}
stage('three:deploy'){
steps{
echo 'step 3'
}

}
}
post{
always{
echo 'This post will always run. There are other options like changed/fixed/aborted/failure etc.'
}
}
