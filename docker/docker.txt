what is the importance .dockerignore?

    While building the docker image, we can make docker to ignore files and folders present in current directory using
    .dockerignore. This significantly reduces the size of the image.

    eg: if foldername(new_folder) is present. we can specify (new_folder) in .dockerignore and that will be ignored during building.

how to map docker ports?
    using -p option when docker run.

    eg: > docker run -p 8080:80 httpd   # here 8080 is the host_port from where we are connecting. 80 is the container port.
    in other terminal , curl http://localhost:8080 will return a response.

docker VOLUME vs docker -v ?
    We can specify dirs and files to be included docker volume using VOLUME or >docker -v command.
    We can create a mount point to the docker.

    > docker run -it -v /path/in/hostname:/path/in/docker --entrypoint bash myapp

    This will show files and dirs of localhost in docker.
    If a file is deleted in localhost or docker, the same will be done on docker or localhost.

    in Dockerfile
    VOLUME <pathname>

    VOLUME sets up dirs as volume in container image while "docker -v" creates volume at runtime.
    It is important to note that "docker -v" data stores in volume is persisted even if
    container is removed whereas if you use VOLUME in dockerfile, the data is not persisted
    if the container is removed.

How to troubleshoot issues with a Docker container?
    1. >docker logs <container id>
    2. >docker ps # if container is not running, > docker start to start.
    3. >docker inspect <container id>
    4. Check the host system has enough resources.
    5. Check docker version, docker engine and docker client.
    6. Check container conflicts: check multiple containers for network settings etc.
