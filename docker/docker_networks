There are 3 networks by default
1) bridge
    bridge is a private internal network created by docker.
    All containers attach to this network.
    usually 172 network.
    containers access each other using this.
    To reach from outside, map to the port of host to port of container.
2) none
    does not have access to any network.

3) host
    if container exposed 5000 port, host machine can access it via 5000.
    Another container should not have 5000 port exposed.


To create a network:
    > docker network create --driver bridge --subnet 172.18.0.0/16 custom-isolated

To attach a network to container:
    >docker run --name mycon --network none alpine

To display networks:
    > docker network ls # ALL bridge, host and null networks are seen.

To inspect a particular network:
    > docker network inspect custom-isolated




DNS:
    Docker has built-in DNS.
    Container can reach each-other using name of the container instead of ip.
