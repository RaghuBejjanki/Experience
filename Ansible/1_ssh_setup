- SSH setup is required for ansible to connect to servers.
  If not already installed, use below command to install ssh on servers:
    > sudo apt install openssh-server

- Make initial connection as "yes" only first time.

- Create ssh key pair
    > ssh-keygen    # OR
    > ssh-keygen -t ed25519  -C "abc_default"   # more complex algorithm than rsa.  -C is comment.
      use passphrase while generating.

    > ls -l .ssh   # .pub and private keys will be generated.

- Copy ssh key pair to each server from local ansible host.
    > ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub <server ip>

- Enter the passphrase
    > ssh x.y.z.a
        enter the passphrase: (instead of password)

- Creating ansible key in ansible server.
    >  ssh-keygen -t ed25519  -C "ansible"
    provide ~/.ssh/ansible.pub

- Copy Ansible key to servers.
    > ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/ansible.pub <server ip>

- Using Ansible key
    > ssh -i ~/.ssh/ansible.pub <server ip> # no password will be asked.

- ssh agent
    > eval $(ssh-agent)   # agent will be running in the background. No password will be asked instead of passphrase.
    > ssh-add # provide passphrase 1 time so that it will be cached.
    If terminal is closed, above 2 commands will be gone. So
    > alias ssha='eval $(ssh-agent) && ssh-add'
    > vi /.bashrc # to add ssha.
